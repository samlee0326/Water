## Introduction

Soyang Dam, the largest multi-purpose dam in Korea, faces water resource management challenges due to global warming. Global warming increases the duration and frequency of days with high temperatures and extreme precipitation events. 

## Our model

We propose a Sequence-to-Sequence model based on bidirectional LSTM with SELU activation function to predict the inflow rate over the next two days.
